This is a simple Netflix Clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that replicates the look and feel of the original Netflix homepage. It features a responsive design, a top navigation bar with a logo and buttons, interactive movie thumbnails with hover effects, and smooth transitions to enhance user experience. This project is purely frontend and does not include real streaming functionality or backend integration. You can run it by opening the index.html file in any browser, and itâ€™s ideal for learning and showcasing basic frontend development skills.
